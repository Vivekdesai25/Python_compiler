# ðŸš€ Python Auto Runner with GitHub Actions

This repo is where I test a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs Python files whenever I push them.
Whenever I add or update a .py file, the workflow finds the changed file(s) and runs them â€” no need to run manually or copy into any other compiler.

It's mainly for practice and experimenting with automation.
Currently using:

1.GitHub Actions
2.Python 3.10
3.Auto-detects changed files using git diff
4.Runs them and shows output in the Actions tab


Still improving it as I go!
